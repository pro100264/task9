<h1>CCS3</h1>
Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features,
    <div class="tip" data-title="The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.">CSS3</div>
is divided into several separate documents called "modules".
Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2,
    preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around
    the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation.
<br><br>
Due to the modularization,  <div class="tip" data-title="The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.">different modules </div> have different stability and statuses.
    As of June 2012, there are over fifty CSS modules published from
    the CSS Working Group., and four of these have been published
    as formal recommendations.
<br><br>
Some modules have  <div class="tip" data-title="The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.">Candidate Recommendation (CR)</div> status and are considered
    moderately stable. At CR stage, implementations are advised to drop
    vendor prefixes.
